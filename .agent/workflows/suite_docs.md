# Orchestrated Suite: Documentation Audit

This suite performs a comprehensive audit of the project's documentation by invoking atomic standalones.

## 1. Semantic Audit
*   Invoke `/audit_context`
*   Verify that the documentation is correctly segmented into Strategy and Reference roles.

## 2. Logical Audit
*   Invoke `/audit_consistency`
*   Verify that there are no internal contradictions or conflicting mandates between peer documents.

## 3. Findings Consolidation
*   Synthesize reports from both atomics into a unified documentation health overview.
